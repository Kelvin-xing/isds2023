    "In this combined teaching module and exercise set, you will be working with structuring data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start out with a recap of some basic function and methods that become available in pandas. Then there will be a short intermezzo, where you will be required to think a bit about how to write readible code and make use of the method chaining opportunities that come with python. Then finally, you will get to work with some more advanced data types that are handled natively with pandas. The structure is as follows:\n",
    "1. Welcome (Back to) Pandas\n",
    "    - DataFrames and Series\n",
    "    - Operations with Elementary Data Types in the Context of Pandas\n",
    "        - Boolean Series\n",
    "        - String Operations\n",
    "        - Numeric Operations and Methods\n",
    "2. Readible Code and Method Chaining\n",
    "3. More Advanced Data Types\n",
    "    - Categorical Data\n",
    "    - Time Series Data\n",
    "    \n",
    "**NOTE:** I might be speaking quite slowly in some of the videos. A good advice is to turn up the speed to x1.25 or x1.5 if you want to get through without spending too much time:)"

The first interval should contain observations with values of `obs_value` up to the 10% quantile. The second interval should contain observations with values of `obs_value` up to the 90% quantile.
